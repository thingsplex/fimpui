Transform node performs more advanced data transformations . The result is assigned to *Result variable*
**Supported transformation types :** 
* Calculate 
* Map 
* JsonPath 
* XPath
* Tempelate 

##### Calculate 
The transformation type executes expression set in *Expression* field and saves result into *Result variable*.
Epression supports all local and global variables using their normal names and input variable as **input** and Left variable as **variable**
Assuming we have variables *address* , expression can be `address+100` , result will be assigned to *Result variable*

##### Map

##### JsonPath

##### Xpath

##### Template
